# GitHub Actions Tutorial

Welcome to the **GitHub Actions Tutorial** repository! This project is designed to help you learn how to automate workflows using GitHub Actionsâ€”a powerful CI/CD and automation tool provided by GitHub. Whether you're a beginner or looking to explore advanced use cases, this tutorial covers the basics and provides practical examples.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions allows you to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code directly in your GitHub repository. Workflows are defined in YAML files and triggered by events like code pushes or pull requests.

---

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub
- Familiarity with JavaScript/Node.js (for the example app)
- Node.js installed locally (optional, for testing)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdulMoiz2493/github-actions-tutorial.git
cd github-actions-tutorial
```

### Explore the Workflows

* Workflow files are located in `.github/workflows/`.
* Check out `ci.yml` for a basic CI pipeline example.

### Set Up the Sample App (optional)

* Navigate to `src/` and run:

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm test
  ```

---

## Example Workflows

This repository includes several example workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

* **ci.yml:** A continuous integration pipeline that runs tests on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.
* More workflows (e.g., deployment, linting) can be added by contributors!

---

## Workflow Status

Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the status of workflows.

---

## Running Locally

To test the sample app locally:

1. Navigate to the `src/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd src
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
